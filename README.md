## Blocks
> The idea is to gradually add notebooks and all kinds of notes to the `building-blocks` folder, which would cover reusable techniques, concepts and pieces of code, lego building blocks, for as many topics as possible in broad machine learning.

## Resources
> Useful resources over the web covering broad ML/CS knowledge.
- [Most valuable ML repos](https://www.theinsaneapp.com/2021/09/best-github-repository-for-machine-learning.html)
- [Data science knowledge repo](https://datajobs.com/data-science-repo)

## GitHubs
> Useful GitHub repositories covering broad ML/CS knowledge.

## Notes
> The idea is to gradually add PDF documents summarising the broad topics of ML into the `notes` folder.

## Papers
> Useful resources related to papers and state-of-the-art ML/CS knowledge.
- [arxiv](https://arxiv.org)
- [Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com)
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)

## Academic
> Useful lectures and university resources on ML/CS topics.
- [NLP at Stanford](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)

## Scratch
> Any other resources that I find useful or interesting.
