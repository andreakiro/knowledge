## Blocks
> The idea is to gradually add notebooks and all kinds of notes to the `building-blocks` folder, which would cover reusable techniques, concepts and pieces of code, lego building blocks, for as many topics as possible in broad machine learning

## Resources
> Useful resources over the web covering broad ML/CS knowledge
- [Most valuable ML repos](https://www.theinsaneapp.com/2021/09/best-github-repository-for-machine-learning.html)
- [Data science knowledge repo](https://datajobs.com/data-science-repo)

## GitHubs
